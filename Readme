Hello !

This is FidoStat, a quick hack of a Log File Analyser for Binkd Log Files.
It is intendet to be used for seeing who has polled an got his mails
today, and for posting a dayly statistic of the polls in your local
statistic echo. If you want to post, you have to pipe the output into a
file, and post this file via the hpt post command to your area.

The programm can't do much at the time of writing, but perhaps it will be
a universal tool one day :)

The logfile binkd.cfg is searched in your standart fidoconfig logfile
directory.

Have phun,
