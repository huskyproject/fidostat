Instructions to build fidostat from source files
------------------------------------------------

0. fidostat depends on the fidoconf, huskylib, and smapi sub-projects of the
   husky project. It is expected that you have already built these sub-projects,
   and that you have already installed the corresponding libraries (fidoconfig,
   husky, and smapi) before attempting to build fidostat.

1. Put the fidostat package in the directory where the other husky packages
   reside:

   /usr/src/packages/        -> fidoconf/
                             -> fidostat/
                             -> huskybse/
                             -> huskylib/
                             -> smapi/
                             ... possibly some other husky packages

2. Read huskybse/INSTALL, and adapt huskymak.cfg to your system.

3. Build and install fidostat:

   $ make clean
   $ make
   $ sudo make install

You're ready.
